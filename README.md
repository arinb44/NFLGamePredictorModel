# NFL Game Predictor Model

A machine learning model that predicts the **win probability** of each team in an NFL game and explains **which factors drove the prediction**.

Built with Python, pandas and scikit-learn on [nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data) data.

## Approach

- **One row per game**, from the home team's perspective. The target is `home_win`.
- **Features are home-minus-away differences** in pregame team strength: offensive and defensive EPA/play, success rate, pass/rush efficiency, turnover rates, recent form, quarterback performance, Elo rating, rest and home-field advantage.
- **No leakage:** every feature uses only information available before kickoff.
- **Walk-forward validation:** train on seasons up to N, test on season N+1.
- **Models:** logistic regression, random forest and gradient boosting, evaluated on log loss, Brier score and calibration.
- **Benchmark:** Vegas closing lines are used only to measure the model, never as a feature. Favorites win about 66.5% of games from 2006 to 2025.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.data_loader        # downloads ~390 MB of data (2006 to present)
python -m src.team_stats         # builds data/processed/team_games.parquet
python -m src.features           # builds data/processed/games_features.parquet
python -m pytest tests           # leakage checks
python -m src.tune_features      # optional: re-tune feature settings (~1 min)
python -m src.train              # walk-forward evaluation + save final model
```

## Features

Every team stat is an exponentially weighted average of the team's earlier games this season,
blended with last season's value (regressed toward the league average). That way week 1 predictions
lean on last year and later weeks on current form.

| Group | Features (home minus away) |
|---|---|
| Offense | EPA/play, neutral-situation EPA, success rate, pass EPA/dropback, rush EPA, explosive rate, sack rate, turnovers, red-zone TD rate, pass rate |
| Defense | the same stats allowed |
| Results | points for/against, point differential, win % |
| Recent form | short-memory point differential and EPA |
| Quarterback | starting QB's EPA/play and CPOE (career history, shrunk toward a replacement-level prior), experience, QB change flag |
| Skill players | share of the team's usual RB/WR/TE touches that is unavailable (injured, suspended, resting), and the biggest single absence |
| Strength | Elo rating |
| Situation | rest days, home-field advantage (trailing 3-season league home margin, 0 at neutral sites), divisional game |

## Evaluation

**Walk-forward:** to predict season T, the model is trained only on seasons before T. The test seasons are split in two:

- **Tuning (2012–2018):** used to choose the feature settings and the regularization strength.
- **Holdout (2019–2025):** never used for any choice. This is the honest estimate.

Log loss is the main metric (lower is better) because the goal is accurate probabilities, not just picking winners.

| Holdout 2019–2025 (1,954 games) | Accuracy | Log loss | Brier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vegas moneyline (benchmark) | 0.664 | 0.6083 | 0.2105 |
| **Logistic regression** | **0.656** | **0.6282** | **0.2191** |
| Logistic regression without player features | 0.647 | 0.6295 | 0.2199 |
| Elo | 0.638 | 0.6367 | 0.2227 |
| Always pick home | 0.537 | 0.6929 | 0.2499 |

The strongest factors are the starting QB's EPA/play, defensive explosive plays allowed, Elo, offensive success rate, QB changes, and missing skill players.

### Skill-player availability

Team stats already reflect the players who have been playing. What they miss is **who is out today**. For each game:

1. **Role size:** each RB, WR and TE gets his share of the team's targets plus carries in earlier games.
2. **Participation:** how regularly he has been playing. It fades while he is out, as the team's stats adjust without him.
3. **Missing:** he is still on the roster but doesn't play.
   - For past games, this means he didn't appear in that game's stats. Inactive lists are public 90 minutes before kickoff, so this is pregame information.
   - For upcoming games, it comes from the injury report (Out or Doubtful) and roster status (IR).

A first version valued players by EPA per game and gave no gain; role size is steadier. On the holdout, player features improve accuracy by 0.9 points, with the biggest gains in games with lopsided absences.
